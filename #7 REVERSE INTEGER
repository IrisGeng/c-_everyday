Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
Example:
Input: 123
Output:  321
Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only hold integers within the 32-bit signed integer range. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.


/* need to consider 32-bits/

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int reverse(int x){
    long rel=0;
    while(x!=0){
        rel=rel*10+x%10;
        x/=10;}
        return rel; 
        }


int main()
{
    int x=658;
    cout<<reverse(x);
    }
